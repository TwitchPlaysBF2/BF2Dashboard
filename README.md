A web portal with customizable gadgets related to the game Battlefield 2, e.g. your favorite BF2 servers, live streams and resources.

Currently under early development.


## Website

The intended platform for the project is web based. You can find it on www.bf2.tv (until I decide not to renew the yearly $25 anymore)


## Windows App

Another way of using BF2.TV is through the app (Windows Desktop Application). It doesn't require the BF2.TV domain to exist.

The idea of a Windows app is to allow more features and better integrations with Windows and the game.

After a successful setup of the app, it also allows you to use the "Join" button from anywhere (web version, app version).


# Project Goals

Kick-starting my frontend know-how and learning more about [Blazor WASM](https://blazor.net/).

Building something useful for the BF2 community.

Having a personal dashboard to see what's going on, before playing a round of BF2. 


# About

Made using [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com) and [ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly](https://blazor.net/).
