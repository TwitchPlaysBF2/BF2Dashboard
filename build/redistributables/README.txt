Q: How to configure the joinme.click launcher to open the game in a windowed state?
A: First, change the filename of `config.yaml` to something else, e.g. `config.orig.yaml`. Then change the filename of `config.windowed-example.yaml` to `config.yaml` for the config to be effective and the game will launch in windowed mode.
